## How This Works

The Flatpak Runtime Tracker:
1. **Runs Weekly**: Executes every Monday at 9:00 AM UTC via GitHub Actions
2. **Monitors Sources**: Checks applications from ublue-os/bluefin, ublue-os/aurora, and ublue-os/bazzite
3. **Detects Outdated Runtimes**: Compares current runtime versions against latest available
4. **Creates Issues**: Automatically opens GitHub issues for applications needing updates
5. **Labels Priority**: Marks top 10 most downloaded apps per runtime as "popular"
6. **Closes Resolved**: Automatically closes issues when runtimes are updated
