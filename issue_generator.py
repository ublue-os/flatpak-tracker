## Flatpak Runtime Update Needed

**Package:** `{package.flatpak_id}`
**Current Runtime:** `{package.current_runtime}`
**Latest Available Runtime:** `{package.latest_runtime}`
**Found in sources:** {sources_info}

### How to Update the Runtime on Flathub

The runtime for this flatpak appears to be outdated. **For app maintainers**, please follow the official Flathub process:

#### Step 1: Update Your Manifest
1. Edit your app's manifest file (e.g., `{package.flatpak_id.replace('app/', '')}.json` or `.yml`)
2. Update the `runtime` field from `{package.current_runtime}` to `{package.latest_runtime}`
3. Update the `runtime-version` field if using separate version specification

#### Step 2: Update SDK (if needed)
- If your app uses an SDK, update it to match the new runtime version
- For GNOME apps: change `org.gnome.Sdk` to the same version as the Platform
- For Freedesktop apps: change `org.freedesktop.Sdk` to match the Platform version

#### Step 3: Test and Submit
1. Test your app locally with the new runtime:
   ```bash
   flatpak-builder build-dir {package.flatpak_id.replace('app/', '')}.json --force-clean
   flatpak-builder --run build-dir {package.flatpak_id.replace('app/', '')}.json your-app-command
   ```
2. Create a pull request to your app's repository on the [flathub GitHub organization](https://github.com/flathub)
3. The Flathub build system will automatically test and build your update

- [Flatpak Manifest Reference](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/manifests.html)
- [Flathub Submission Guidelines](https://docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/submission)

### For Users

This runtime update will be handled by the app maintainers. Once updated on Flathub, you can get the latest version with:
```bash
flatpak update {package.flatpak_id.replace('app/', '')}
```

### Additional Information

This issue was automatically created by the flatpak-updater bot that monitors multiple ublue-os flatpak lists:
- [ublue-os/bluefin system-flatpaks.list](https://github.com/ublue-os/bluefin/blob/main/flatpaks/system-flatpaks.list)
- [ublue-os/aurora system-flatpaks.list](https://github.com/ublue-os/aurora/blob/main/flatpaks/system-flatpaks.list)  
- [ublue-os/bazzite gnome flatpaks](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/blob/main/installer/gnome_flatpaks/flatpaks)
- [ublue-os/bazzite kde flatpaks](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/blob/main/installer/kde_flatpaks/flatpaks)
- [ublue-os/bluefin bazaar config](https://github.com/ublue-os/bluefin/blob/main/system_files/shared/usr/share/ublue-os/bazaar/config.yaml)

- [ublue-os/bazzite bazaar config](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/blob/main/system_files/desktop/shared/usr/share/ublue-os/bazaar/config.yaml)

If this is a false positive or the runtime is intentionally pinned to an older version for compatibility reasons, please close this issue with a comment explaining why.

ðŸ”„ **Package No Longer Tracked**

This issue is being automatically closed because:
- The package `{flatpak_id}` is no longer included in any of the monitored flatpak lists
- We only track packages that are currently shipped in ublue-os distributions

**What this means:**
- This package was removed from the system flatpak lists in the source repositories
- Historical applications that are no longer shipped are automatically cleaned up

If this package should still be tracked, please verify it exists in one of these current lists:
