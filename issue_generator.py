## Flatpak Runtime Update Needed

**Package:** `{package.flatpak_id}`
**Current Runtime:** `{package.current_runtime}`
**Latest Available Runtime:** `{package.latest_runtime}`
**Monthly Downloads:** `{package.monthly_downloads}`
**Found in sources:** {sources_info}

### Look for an existing pull request!

Look for the repositoy of this application in [github.com/flathub](https://github.com/flathub) - in many cases a pull request might already exist. If this is the case then you can help out by testing the updated flatpak and adding more information to an existing issue! Usually just getting more testers on a new version is enough to help the maintainers! 

The bot will autoclose issues here, you can just work directly upstream, this issue is only a sign post!

### How to Update the Runtime on Flathub

The runtime for this flatpak appears to be outdated. **For app maintainers**, please follow the official Flathub process:

#### Step 1: Update Your Manifest
1. Edit your app's manifest file (e.g., `{package.flatpak_id.replace('app/', '')}.json` or `.yml`)
2. Update the `runtime` field from `{package.current_runtime}` to `{package.latest_runtime}`
3. Update the `runtime-version` field if using separate version specification

#### Step 2: Update SDK (if needed)
- If your app uses an SDK, update it to match the new runtime version
- For GNOME apps: change `org.gnome.Sdk` to the same version as the Platform
- For Freedesktop apps: change `org.freedesktop.Sdk` to match the Platform version

#### Step 3: Test and Submit
1. Test your app locally with the new runtime:
   ```bash
   flatpak-builder build-dir {package.flatpak_id.replace('app/', '')}.json --force-clean
   flatpak-builder --run build-dir {package.flatpak_id.replace('app/', '')}.json your-app-command
   ```
2. Create a pull request to your app's repository on the [flathub GitHub organization](https://github.com/flathub)
3. The Flathub build system will automatically test and build your update

- [Flatpak Manifest Reference](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/manifests.html)
- [Flathub Submission Guidelines](https://docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/submission)

### For Users

This runtime update will be handled by the app maintainers. Once updated on Flathub, you can get the latest version with:
```bash
flatpak update {package.flatpak_id.replace('app/', '')}
```

### Additional Information

This issue was automatically created by the flatpak-updater bot that monitors multiple ublue-os flatpak lists:
- [ublue-os/bluefin system-flatpaks.list](https://github.com/ublue-os/bluefin/blob/main/flatpaks/system-flatpaks.list)
- [ublue-os/aurora system-flatpaks.list](https://github.com/ublue-os/aurora/blob/main/flatpaks/system-flatpaks.list)  
- [ublue-os/bazzite gnome flatpaks](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/blob/main/installer/gnome_flatpaks/flatpaks)
- [ublue-os/bazzite kde flatpaks](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/blob/main/installer/kde_flatpaks/flatpaks)
- [ublue-os/bluefin bazaar config](https://github.com/ublue-os/bluefin/blob/main/system_files/shared/etc/bazaar/config.yaml)
- [ublue-os/aurora bazaar config](https://github.com/ublue-os/aurora/blob/main/system_files/shared/etc/bazaar/config.yaml)
- [ublue-os/bazzite bazaar config](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/blob/main/system_files/desktop/shared/usr/share/ublue-os/bazaar/config.yaml)

If this is a false positive or the runtime is intentionally pinned to an older version for compatibility reasons, please close this issue with a comment explaining why.

This issue is being automatically closed because:

- This package was removed from the system flatpak lists in the source repositories
- Historical applications that are no longer shipped are automatically cleaned up
